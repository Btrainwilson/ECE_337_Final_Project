    Here are the steps of operation:
    0) State Before Data bytes are sent
    1) TXPU resets CRC Calculator (pulse reset signal once)  // Constant reset until data starts  
    2) TXPU waits until all data bytes have been sent.
    3) TXPU raises CRC_Calc and waits for CRC_Send to be high (also idles transmission line)
    4) When CRC_Send is high, cycle through select line for both bytes
    5) Once 2 bytes are transmitted(i.e. CRC Bytes), set CRC calc low
