    Here are the steps of operation:
    0) State Before Data bytes are sent
    1) TXPU resets CRC Calculator (pulse reset signal once)
    2) TXPU waits until all data bytes have been sent.
    3) TXPU raises CRC_Calc and waits for CRC_Send to be high (also idles transmission line)
    4) When CRC_Send is high, TXPU enables bitstuffer to take the serial out from the CRC instead of the mux and counts 2 bytes from the CRC.
    5) Once 2 bytes are transmitted(i.e. CRC Bytes), reassign the bit stuffer for normal operation and set CRC_Calc low.
